# Spam-classification
Abstract:
This GitHub repository presents a comprehensive solution for SMS spam classification leveraging machine learning techniques. With the proliferation of spam messages in SMS communication, the need for an efficient classifier is paramount. This project provides a step-by-step guide and codebase to create a robust SMS spam classifier, enabling users to filter out unwanted messages from their inbox.

Key Features:
1. **Data Preprocessing:** We discuss the importance of data preprocessing in cleaning and transforming raw SMS data into a format suitable for machine learning algorithms.

2. **Feature Engineering:** Explore the creation of relevant features from text data, including techniques like TF-IDF and word embeddings.

3. **Model Selection:** Compare and contrast various machine learning models such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, and Neural Networks for their effectiveness in spam classification.

4. **Evaluation Metrics:** Understand the selection of appropriate evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, to assess model performance.

5. **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimize model performance through hyperparameter tuning, ensuring the best possible results.

6. **Deployment:** Learn how to deploy the trained model for real-time spam classification in SMS messages.

7. **GitHub Repository:** Access the full source code, datasets, and documentation in this repository to replicate and extend the SMS spam classification solution.

By following this guide and using the provided codebase, users can build their SMS spam classifiers, contributing to a more spam-free and efficient SMS communication experience.
