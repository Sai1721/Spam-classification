## Introduction

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to classify emails as either spam or not spam. The model is implemented using Python and Jupyter notebooks, making it accessible and easy to understand. Google Colaboratory is utilized for collaborative development and execution of the notebook.

## Features

- **Machine Learning Model:** Implements a machine learning model (e.g., Naive Bayes, SVM) for email spam classification.
- **Interactive Notebook:** Leverages the interactivity of Jupyter notebooks for easy experimentation and understanding of the classification process.
- **Collaboration on Colab:** Enables collaborative development and execution of the notebook on Google Colaboratory.
- **Visualizations:** Includes visualizations to better understand the dataset, model performance, and feature importance.

## Installation

### Google Colaboratory
1. Open the [Google Colab Notebook](link_to_your_colab_notebook.ipynb).
2. Save a copy to your Google Drive.
3. Open the notebook and run the cells sequentially.

### Local Setup (Optional)
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sai1721/Spam-classification
   cd Spam-classification
   ```

## Dataset



## Description
In this project, I aim to develop an efficient email spam classification system using machine learning techniques. By leveraging supervised learning algorithms, the model will be trained on a labeled dataset to distinguish between spam and legitimate emails. Feature engineering will play a crucial role in extracting relevant information, such as email content, sender information, and other metadata.

The project involves preprocessing steps, including text cleaning, tokenization, and vectorization, to prepare the data for training. I'll explore various machine learning algorithms like Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, or deep learning models to find the most effective approach for spam detection.

Evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score will be utilized to assess the model's performance. The project will also involve tuning hyperparameters and optimizing the chosen algorithm for better accuracy and generalization.

Finally, I plan to create a user-friendly interface to demonstrate the effectiveness of the spam classification model, allowing users to input an email and receive a classification result, providing a practical solution for spam filtering in email communication.
